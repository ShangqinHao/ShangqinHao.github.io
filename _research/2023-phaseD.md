* Obtained elasticity and density of phase D under the lower-mantle conditions
* Proved that the accumulation of phase D may account for seismic anisotropy rather than low-velocity
anomalies in the uppermost lower mantle (ULM)
* Suggested that the decomposition of phase D in the ULM causes a density jump,
possibly explaining some discontinuities in subduction zones
