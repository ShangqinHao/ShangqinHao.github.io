* Inverted for the 3D chemical composition and thermal state of the lower mantle based on seismic
tomography and mineral elasticity data
* Found that velocity heterogeneities in the upper lower mantle mainly result from thermal anomalies,
  whereas those in the lowermost mantle mainly result from compositional or phase variations
* Found that LLSVPs have âˆ¼500 K higher temperature, higher bridgmanite and iron content than the ambient mantle,
  supporting the origin from an ancient basal magma ocean
