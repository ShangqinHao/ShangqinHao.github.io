* Imaged the Moho and mantle transition zone (MTZ) discontinuities beneath Alaska by stacking long-period teleseismic SH waves
* Observed crustal thickness is generally consistent with surface topography and gravity measurements
* Suggested that the Pacific slab may have penetrated into the upper MTZ under central Alaska but not
under the Alaska Peninsula
