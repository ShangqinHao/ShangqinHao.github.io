* Calculated the elasticity of akimotoite under the mantle conditions using first-principles calculations
* Estimated the V<sub>P</sub>, V<sub>S</sub>, and density contrasts caused by the akimotoite-related transitions
* Proved that the discontinuity at the depth of ∼700-750 km in cold slabs could result from the decomposition of pyrope rather than the akimotoite-bridgmanite transition
